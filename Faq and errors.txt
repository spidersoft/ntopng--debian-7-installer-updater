Errors and  FAQ:

If you are using a old version from ntopng, you cant compile geoip and you have got this error:

Flow.cpp:296:40: error: 'struct ndpi_flow_struct' has no member named 'detected_os'
make: *** [Flow.o] Error 1

Do:

make clean

And delete complete dir, again lauch script.

Thanks to Filippo for advice.
